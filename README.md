Stock Track allows you to search for a stock by ticker symbol and date. The app then utilizes a polygon.io API which returns pricing details about the stock on the selected date.

Once stock information has been returend a button to save the stock information from the selected date to your user profile becomes available. When a user saves stock data a record is created on their user profile which allows all saved stocks to be viewed on a single page. Stocks can be removed from a users profile by clicking the X button on an individual stock record.

Additionally each user has a tailored dashboard in which they can view information about their account and metrics around their saved stocks.
